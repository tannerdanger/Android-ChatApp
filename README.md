This application, lovingly nicknamed 'HooliChat', was developed with a team of 3 individuals for a mobile apps class. The frontend is all written in Android/Java using Android Studio. It uses Google's Firebase, Maps and Places APIs, as well as a free-tier weather API.

The [back end](https://github.com/tannerdanger/ChatApp-WebService) is served through a node.js server I wrote, which is hosted on Heroku. It uses postgresql to store user and message data, and firebase for user notification.
